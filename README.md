# DATA COMPRESSOR

## Huffman Coding
Goal of this project is to design compression programs based on Huffman Coding. It aims to reduce the size of the given input.

## Objectives
The main objective is to minimize the weighted expected length of the code by means of assigning shorter codes to frequently-used characters and longer coded to seldom/rarely-used characters.
It certainly reduces the total numbers of bits of original data, almost halved the total bits after compression.

## Conditions and Constraints
The program can compress text file consisting of 128 ASCII characters.
It accepts all the uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numbers and special characters and convert them into their ASCII code and then to their corresponding binary values.
